Refactoring exercices to learn S.O.L.I.D principles

# Principles
1. SRP—The Single Responsibility Principle
2. OCP—The Open–Closed Principle.
3. LSP—The Liskov Substitution Principle.
4. ISP—The Interface Segregation Principle
5. DIP—The Dependency Inversion Principle.

# Purpose: avoid these Poor Design
1. **Rigidity**—The system is hard to change because every change forces many other changes to other parts of the
system.
2. **Fragility**—Changes cause the system to break in places that have no conceptual relationship to the part that
   was changed.
3. **Immobility**—It is hard to disentangle the system into components that can be reused in other systems.
4. **Viscosity**—Doing things right is harder than doing things wrong.
5. **Needless Complexity**—The design contains infrastructure that adds no direct benefit.
6. **Needless Repetition**—The design contains repeating structures that could be unified under a single abstrac-
   tion.
7. **Opacity**—It is hard to read and understand. It does not express its intent well.
